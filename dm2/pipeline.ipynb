    "**Medium articles** are used to disseminate knowledge and are written on a wide range of technical and non-technical topics. Users subscribe to different reading lists where reading lists represent either domains or certain topics. This naturally gives rise to a network structure where articles may belong to the same reading lists and hence are related to each other. Each article belongs to a certain topic. Automatically assigning articles to topics is very valuable for search applications. **The goal of this task is to classify articles by predicting their topics.**\n",

The task is to classify articles into tags (i.e., topics), leveraging the network structure arising from relations using the subscription lists. Specifically, two nodes are connected if they share at least one list.\n",
